# Kooloc
Mobile application that ...

# Use
To compile the whole application, we used a Docker environment.
In order to compile and launch all the components, here are the instructions :

In the Kooloc folder :
    - To launch the app : docker compose up (-d if you want it detached)
    - To stop all the containers started by the launch : docker compose down

Note : To load the images for the first time, you'll need to give admin access to docker so executing : sudo docker compose up
